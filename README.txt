This repo contains example code described in my inheritance rant talk,
see https://github.com/slinkp/inheritance_talk

Look through the commit history to see step-by-step refactoring
of an inheritance-based design to a composition-based design.
Eg:  `git log --reverse -p pre_refactoring refactoring_done`
